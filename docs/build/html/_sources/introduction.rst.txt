What is the VISION Toolkit?
---------------------------

The **V**\ irtual **I**\ ntegration of **S**\ atellite and **In**\ -Situ
**O**\ bservation **N**\ etworks (**VISION**) Toolkit is a set of command-line
tools and plugins to enable better integration of models and observations
to enhance our confidence in future climate projections.


Basic usage
-----------

The toolkit can be used through the command line via a dedicated
:ref:`CLI <Command-line Interface (CLI) Reference>` or as a Python
module via the
:ref:`Python API <Application Programming Interface (API) Reference>`.

.. seealso::

   Guidance is available in this documentation
   for :ref:`installing <Installation>` and
   :ref:`running <Quickstart>` the toolkit.


Background
----------

The VISION toolkit is developed and maintained by a team from the
`National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) <ncas-home_>`_. It is
funded by the `Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) <nerc-home_>`_,
in partnership with the
`Met Office <met-office-home_>`_, as part of the
`Twinning Capability for the Natural Environment (TWINE) <twine-projects_>`_
