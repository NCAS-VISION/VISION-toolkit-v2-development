Examples
========

Examples available in this documentation demonstrate use of data
from two different models as input to the VISION tool, namely:

* the `Unified Model (UM) <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/modelling-systems/unified-model>`_;
* the `Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model <https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf>`_;

as well as two formats of observational data:

* flights paths;
* satellite swaths.

Note this only showcases a subset of possibilities for
supported models and observational inputs. For rules on input
data which the VISION toolkit is capable of handling, indicating
further possibilities, please see the :ref:`DataRequirements`
section.
