Examples
========

Examples available in this documentation demonstrate use of data
from two different models as input to the VISION tool, namely:

* the `Unified Model (UM) <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/modelling-systems/unified-model>`_;
* the `Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model <https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf>`_;

as well as two formats of observational data:

* flights paths;
* satellite swaths.

Note this only showcases a subset of possibilities for
supported models and observational inputs. For rules on input
data which the VISION toolkit is capable of handling, indicating
further possibilities, please see the :ref:`DataRequirements`
section.


Examples using the UM
---------------------

Examples using the UM and flight paths
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [UF1]: UM model data co-located onto FAAM STANCO campaign flight path
* [UF2]: UM model data co-located onto FAAM STANCO campaign flight path (overriding start time)
* [UF3]: UM model data co-located onto FAAM STANCO campaign flight path (different overriding start time)
* [UF4]: FAAM STANCO campaign flight track (from observational input) preview only (no data)


Examples using the UM and satellite swaths
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [US1]: UM model data co-located onto a satellite swath
* [US2]: UM model data co-located onto a (different) satellite swath
* [US3]: UM model data co-located onto a (different) satellite swath
* [US4]: UM model data co-located onto a (different) satellite swath
* [US5]: UM model data co-located onto a full satellite orbit of swaths
* [US6]: UM model data co-located onto three consecutive full satellite orbits of swaths
* [US7]: UM model data co-located onto a full revolution of consecutive full satellite orbits of swaths
* [US8]: Particular satellite swath (from observational input) discrete sampling geometry preview only (no data)
* [US9]: Particular satellite swath (from observational input) discrete sampling geometry preview only (no data)


Examples using the WRF Model
----------------------------

Examples using WRF and flight paths
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
